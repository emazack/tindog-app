## Project Description
This project was built using JavaScript classes and some of the ES6 practices. During the development process, I learned how to leverage the power of classes in JavaScript to organize my code. Additionally, I implemented some of the new features introduced in ES6, such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring assignments, to make my code more concise and expressive.
